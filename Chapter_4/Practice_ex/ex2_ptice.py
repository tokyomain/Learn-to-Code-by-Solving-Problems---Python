# Write a program that, given the correct answers to the exam, 
# determines who of the three was right â€“ whose sequence contains 
# the most correct answers.

# Input:
# 1 : int > N( 1<= N >= 100) > Number of questions > ie  5
# 2 : str > of N letters A, B, C > correct answers > BACBB 

# Output :
# 1 : M > largest number of correct answers.
# 2 : Names of the boys in alphabetical order si acertaron al menos una
