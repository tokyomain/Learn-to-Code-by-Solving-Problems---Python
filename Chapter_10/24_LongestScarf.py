# Scarf whose length is 'n' feet and each foot has a specific color
# You also have 'm' relatives
# Each relative indicates what their desired scarflooks like by specifying 
# the color of its first foot and last foot.

# Your goal is to cut your original scarf in such a way as to produce the
# longest desired scarf for one of your relatives.

# Input: 
# 1/ A line containing the integer scarf length 'n' and integer number of
#relatives 'm', separated by a space.   1 < 'n' 'm' < 100.000

# 2/ A line containing n integers separated by spaces. Each integer specifies
#  the color of one foot of scarf in order from the first foot to the last foot.
# Each integer is between 1 and 1,000,000

# 3/ m lines, one per relative, containing two integers separated by a
# space. These numbers describe the relativeâ€™s desired scarf: the first
# integer is the desired color of the first foot, and the second integer
# is the desired color of the last foot.

# Output:
# Output the length of the longest desired scarf that can be produced by cutting
# your original scarf.
